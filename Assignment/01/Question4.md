# Q4

## Statement 1:

**True**  
   Perfect rationality requires an agent to make the best possible decisions based on complete information of its environment. For e.g. A self-driving car that cannot sense pedestrians cannot make perfectly rational decisions about braking and steering.

## Statement 2:

**False**  
   A pure reflex agent selects actions based only on current percept, without considering any sequences of precepts. For e.g. an agent fails in a game of chess because it needs to consider a sequence of moves and anticipate opponentâ€™s strategies.

## Statement 3:

**True**  
   In an environment where all actions lead to the same outcome, every agent will behave rationally. For example, an environment where the agent must press a single button to be rewarded.

## Statement 4:

**False**  
   The agent function maps a sequence of percepts to actions, while the agent program implements this function using specific algorithms.

## Statement 5:

**False**  
   Some agents may require infinite memory as computational resources, making them impossible to implement on real-life machines.

## Statment 6:

**True**  
   An agent selecting actions at random in a deterministic environment will be rational as all actions lead to the same result. For example, if an environment has 100 buttons, pressing any of them will give the same reward.

## Statement 7:

**True**  
   An agent can be perfectly rational in multiple environments. For example, a self-driving car that operates in different cities with different layouts.

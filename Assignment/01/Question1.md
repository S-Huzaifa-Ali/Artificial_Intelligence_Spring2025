# Q1

## a). Objections carrying weight.

1) Mathematical Objection: Turing addresses the mathematical objection, which is based on Gödel’s incompleteness theorem. The objection argues that there are truths that humans can recognize but machines cannot due to the inherent limitations of the formal systems. Turing counters this by suggesting that no single mind can solve all problems, but machines could still surpass human intelligence in many areas.

2) Lady Lovelace’s Objection: Turing discusses Lady Lovelace’s objection, which claims that machines can only do what they are programmed to do and cannot exhibit true originality. Turing counters this by suggesting that machines could be designed to learn from experience, potentially leading to unexpected or creative behaviour.

## b). Are the refutations valid?

1) Mathematical Objection: Turing’s response to the mathematical objection is pragmatic. He acknowledges that machines cannot solve all problems by they can still outperform humans in many areas. This argument holds today, as AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains.

2) Lady Lovelace’s Objection: Turing’s response to Lady Lovelace’s objection suggested that machines could learn and exhibit unexpected behavior. While AI systems can learn from data, they do not possess goals or desires in the way humans do, which raises questions about nature of originality and whether it requires intent.

## c). New objections arising from developments:

1) AI systems are increasingly capable of automating tasks traditionally performed by humans, leading to concerns about job displacement and economic inequality.

2) AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking, adversarial attacks, and misuse.  
   For example, AI-powered systems can be manipulated to produce incorrect results or used for malicious purposes like deepfakes or autonomous cyberattacks.

3) As AI systems are becoming more integrated in daily life, there is a huge risk that humans may become overly dependent on them, leading to a loss of skills, creativity or autonomy.

## d). Turing's Prediction

Turing predicted that a machine would successfully pass a Turing test by the year 2000. However, the complexity of passing a Turing test was underestimated. Today, the power of machines has advanced rapidly. As of right now, there’s a good chance of a machine passing Turing’s Test.
